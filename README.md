# President Vote: Obama to Trump

# Research Question

**This project explore the question: To what extent do attitudes toward immigration explain the switching of votes of 2012 Obama supporters who became 2016 Trump supporters?**

Polls have shown that people from certain demographic groups were more likely to switch theirvotes than others.But what might explain why some people within a group switched, while others didn’t? One theory is that attitudes toward immigration became especially salient during the 2016 campaign. Most attempts is to assess this have involved fitting big,complicated logistic regression models. This is useful but not really sufficient to explore this problem, so we will explore the data and then fit a big and complicated logistic regression model.  We won’t attempt to  assess  cause-and-effect, but we can get a sense of  whether attitudes toward immigration had explanatory power over and above demographic shifts.

# Data

We’ll use the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, a very large survey of a nationally representative sample of 64,600 adults. The investigators asked questions to the sample both before and after the election, although not all the  pre-election respondents replied to the post-election survey. The data is available in various formats at http://cces.gov.harvard.edu/data.
